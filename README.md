# Wilson-Coding-Samples
Work done in Java, R, and Python


Two labs done in Java are beginner experience/introduction into coding and are meant to serve as a benchmark to evaluate progression.

Python file is personal work done to echance skills in Python. Problems are pulled from the website projecteuler.net which has a repository of Math problems ranging in difficulty from beginner to expert, and are meant to be solved via programming. There are several hundred of these problems and the solutions included are only the problems I have successfully completed so far. 

The R work done in the pdf file was work done in a graduate Statistical Methods course and the corresponding csv files are included. Each of the problems analyzes a specific dataset statistically. The RMD file is personal work done to enhance visualization skills using RStudio. Data is pulled from the uber-raw-data-apr14 csv file that is included. 

The powerBI file is a simple visualization of a the Uber data similar to what was done in R.
